# Particle Arduino Garage Door Opener

This repository covers the things needed to create a remote garage door opener that can be used with systems for home automation access.  I use this with ([SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com)) to control my garage door from my phone.

Hardware interaction happens using an Arduino compatible ([Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit)) which acts as the controller used to handle the interaction of the app with the physical garage door.

### Project goals

- Control open/close of door
- Relay status of door (closed / closing / open / opening) to remote service
- Provide warning that door will move (flash light)
- Not impact existing safety beam functionality of opener or prevent usage of originally installed wired control button
- Work with Genie opener


### To-do:
- Add screenshots and schematic
- Add Groovy code used by SmartThings handler
- Add full parts list
- Write installation guide

## Installation
 - Coming soon
